# Annie Mewkill — Geospatial Data & GIS Portfolio

I am a GIS master’s student at San Diego State University focused on geospatial data processing, spatial analysis, and reproducible workflows for urban, housing, and public health applications.  
My work emphasizes cleaning, validating, and transforming Census and other geospatial datasets using Python and R to support downstream analysis and visualization.

## Portfolio
🌐 https://anniemewkill.github.io  
Selected projects demonstrating geospatial data ingestion, preprocessing, analysis, and interactive visualization using Python, ArcGIS Pro, Leaflet, and p5.js.

## Featured Projects

- **Homeless Encampments & Social Determinants of Health (San Diego)**  
  End-to-end workflow ingesting point data and Census ZCTA boundaries, performing spatial joins, and preparing analysis-ready datasets for mapping and exploration.  
  *Tools:* Python (GeoPandas), ACS, ZCTAs, ArcGIS Pro, Leaflet  
  → https://anniemewkill.github.io/projects/encampments-leaflet.html

- **ACS Census Tract–Level Data Processing Pipeline**  
  Cleaning, normalizing, and aggregating ACS 5-year estimates to produce consistent tract-level datasets for spatial analysis and choropleth mapping.  
  *Tools:* Python, Census ACS, TIGER/Line, ArcGIS Pro  
  → https://anniemewkill.github.io/projects/acs-ct.html

- **Exploratory Spatial Visualization (p5.js)**  
  Interactive prototype exploring spatial patterns from preprocessed datasets, emphasizing rapid iteration and visual debugging of data issues.  
  *Tools:* JavaScript, p5.js  
  → https://anniemewkill.github.io/projects/p5-viz.html
